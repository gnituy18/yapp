# yapp

Yapp stands for **yaml app**. It's an easy way to create an app **instantly and without bugs** using just yaml files and tools you're already familiar with. Sounds crazy? Let me explain.

## A 'normal' app

This is basicly how every app look like. Every app has an user interface that users can interact with. An app then take the user's inputs, do a bunch of bit manipulation, sometimes save some bits into a database and finally throw new stuff back to the UI.

Let's take web apps for example. It's pretty common. We use them all the time. Imagine building X app this way. You will be surprise how many problems you have to deal with by appling the 'normal' way.
- Should we use X framework?
- Should we use X programming language?
- Should we use X or Y package?
- Should we replace X with Y for better Z?
- Should we rewrite the whole thing?
- ...(the list goes on)

I want to point out the 1st problem:
> We have infinite options and it's time consuming.

## A yapp


## Implementation
```
$ touch <name>.yaml
```
That's it! You have your app created locally.

## Limitation

## Why yaml?

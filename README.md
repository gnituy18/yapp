# yapp

Yapp stands for **yaml app**. It's an easy way to create an app **instantly and without bugs** using just yaml files and tools you're already familiar with. Sounds crazy? Let me explain.

## A 'normal' app

This is basicly how every app look like. Every app has an user interface that users can interact with. An app then take the user's inputs, do a bunch of bit manipulation, sometimes save some bits into a database and finally throw new stuff back to the UI.

Here's how a web app look like. Imagine building a X app using this architecture. You will be surprise that it takes more effort than you think.  

I want to point out the 1st problem:
> We have infinite options and we're not sure how to deal with it.

## A yapp


## Implementation
```
$ touch <name>.yaml
```
That's it! You have your app created locally.

## Limitation

## Why yaml?

# yapp

## What's yapp
Yapp stands for **yaml app**. It's a way to create apps you want using just yaml files and tools you're already konw **instantly and without bugs**.

Sounds crazy? Let me explain. You can also jump to the implementation [here](#implementation)

## Here's a 'normal' web app



## Implementation
```
$ touch <name>.yaml
```
That's it! You have your app created locally.

## Limitation

## Why yaml?

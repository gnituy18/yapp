# yapp

## What's yapp
Yapp stands for **yaml app**. It's a way to create apps you want using just yaml files and tools you're already konw **instantly and without bugs**.

Sounds crazy? Let me explain. You can also jump to the implementation [here](#implementation)
![app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7200393/204150679-e72845cd-a0c0-4507-9322-27851b4c342c.png)

This is how every app look like. Every app has an user interface that users can interact with.


## Implementation
```
$ touch <name>.yaml
```
That's it! You have your app created locally.

## Limitation

## Why yaml?
